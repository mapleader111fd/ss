  "profile_tab_faq_2_q": "How is the rating calculated?",
  "profile_tab_faq_2_a": "The system calculates a rating change for every participant in a competition, \nusing the ELO principle. This means that in addition to your final position,\nother players and their ratings are taken into account too.",

  "profile_tab_faq_3_q": "When do competitions take place?",
  "profile_tab_faq_3_a": "An anonymous person organizes competitions for each\nday, which take place 19:00 - 22:00. The person also sponsors each race with a prize.\nThe competitions are inserted into the application every day at 14:00.",

  "profile_tab_faq_4_q": "How are tracks selected for the competitions?",
  "profile_tab_faq_4_a": "The anonymous man makes his choice randomly. A track qualifies for a certain\nclass competition only when it has been completed at least once by a vehicle which belongs to the specified class.",

  "profile_tab_faq_5_q": "How to participate in competitions?",
  "profile_tab_faq_5_a": "There is no need to pre-register for competitions. About one minute\nbefore the start, the starting point is opened and everyone can join. You must\nkeep in mind that you need a vehicle of the same class.",

  "profile_tab_faq_6_q": "Can I organize competitions myself?",
  "profile_tab_faq_6_a": "While normal races can be started by everyone, organizing competitions is not available for all.\nThe option is only available for drivers who\nhave reached a rating of at least 1700.",

  "profile_tab_faq_7_q": "I achieved a high position, but still lost some rating. Why?",
  "profile_tab_faq_7_a": "The ELO system takes into account\nother factors too. If you achieved a good position and did not gain ELO, then probably the\noverall level was low and the system predicted a better position for you.",

  "profile_tab_faq_8_q": "What's the difference between a sprint and a circuit?",
  "profile_tab_faq_8_a": "If you create a sprint race, then you won't have the chance to\nset the amount of laps. In case of a circuit, you are obliged to choose the amount of laps.\nThe minimum amount of laps must be at least two."
